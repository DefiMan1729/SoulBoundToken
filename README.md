# Soul Bound Token (non-transferable NFT)
These tokens differ from an NFT as are they non-transferable. A wallet can have a soul bound token (or an account bound token) to signal certain attributes such as:
<p>-paid for an event ticket
<p>-successfully completed a training/certification 

Web3 applications can pick up whether a public wallet has a particular soul bound token to offer differentiated services.
